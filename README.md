# Sampler() 

Sampler() is a social and interactive digital audio workstation. Sampler() allows you to upload audio files, save regions and notes within the audioâ€™s waveform, trigger region playback in real-time and adjust playback speed/pitch while you play.

Users can upload kits (audio files) and browse kits that have been uploaded by other users. Within a kit, users can interact with the waveform of the file in a couple different ways. 

### Zoom and Pitch

Next to the playback controls, users will find two knobs, one that controls the playback speed of the file, and another that zooms in and out of the waveform. 

### Regions

Below the waveform, users will find the region controls. By clicking on the tabs assigned to available regions, interactive highlighted sections will appear within the waveform. These highlighted regions can be dragged around and resized. 

#### Memory Region

The 6th region tab generates a region that can be used to save the highlighted section that the user defines. These saved regions become available to all users. 

### Loading Regions

On the right hand side of the kit, users will be able to see all regions that have been saved on that kit. By cue-ing them (with the + button on the region card), users will be able to load them into the waveform with the "load" buttons located on the region controls beneath the waveform.
